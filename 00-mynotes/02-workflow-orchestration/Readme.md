## Definations from coursera website.

## What is a data lake?
A data lake is a storage repository designed to capture and store a large amount of all types of raw data. The data can be structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Once itâ€™s in the data lake, the data can be used in machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and models for business purposes. It can also be transferred to a data warehouse after processing. 

## What is a data warehouse?
A data warehouse is a centralized repository and information system used to develop insights and inform decisions with business intelligence. Like an actual warehouse, data gets processed and organized into categories to be placed on its "shelves" that are called **data marts**.

Data warehouses store organized data from multiple sources, such as relational databases, and employ online analytical processing (OLAP) to analyze data. The warehouses perform functions on the data such as extraction, cleaning, transformation, and more.
